-- first time we dont know the system password so first we have to unlock the system or forgot the password of system user then write

/ as sysdba
SELECT username , account_status FROM dba_users WHERE username = "SYSTEM";
ALTER USER system ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
ALTER USER system IDENTIFIED BY "Oracle#123"
SELECT username , account_status FROM dba_users WHERE username = "SYSTEM";
EXIT

-- after this we have to just reopen the sql plus then we have to login with username system and password Oracle#123
-- now create local user 

CREATE user c##24CE137 IDENTIFIED BY "dhruvin2907";

-- C## prefix is a mandatory naming convention for common users and roles
-- now connect user witch is created 

connect c##24CE137/dhruvin2907;

-- this will fail becaue we are try on the system user so we have to first exit the sql puls then we have to login back to system user then we have to grant all privileges to that user 

GRANT ALL privileges TO c##24CE137;
